            HTML, it's a beautiful language. As it states it is a HyperText Markup Language. 
            <br>
            It is the foundation and the structural support for every website on the internet.
            <br>
            Almost any language is compatible with HTML to create a website if used correctly, one of these is CSS or Ruby.
